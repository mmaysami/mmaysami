### Hi there 👋

I am told this is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository, apparently for me to talk about me. 🤷🏼‍♂️

### 🖥 Work

* I am currently working as a staff data scientist at [Shopify](https://github.com/shopify). After having spent a number of years extolling the virtues of automated testing and test-driven development, I am now focusing on helping teams share their work with the open source community.
* Prior to this, I was working as a senior advisor of data science at [CVS Health](https://cvshealth.com/), building a variety pricing and optimization workflows.
* Prior to _that_, I was building and manging various analytics and data driven products with market research focus at [Nielsen IQ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/).

* Prior to _that_, I was technical project manager and building several data driven models in oil and gas industry.

### 🕹 Non-Work

* 📚 I’m currently reading [...]().
* In my spare time (ha!), I play sports mostly and read/listen on various topics.
* 🏃 I used to .... Now I just do it for the sheer enjoyment of it.

### 🎓 Learnings

* Spanish. Grew up speaking English & French and have precious little opportunity to make use of the latter here in Boston.
* Java, amusingly enough. The first language I learned, but I have been away a _long_ while.

### 🎲 Random
